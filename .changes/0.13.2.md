# 0.13.2 (April 06, 2021)

BUG FIXES:
 - Update `terraform-json` to support 0.15 changes in plan & config JSON output ([#153](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-exec/issues/153))
 - Update `go-getter` to prevent race conditions where consumers would require `go-cleanhttp` `>=0.5.2` (which tfexec itself didn't depend on until now) ([#154](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-exec/issues/154))

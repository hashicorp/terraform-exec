# 0.17.3 (August 31, 2022)

Please note that terraform-exec now requires Go 1.18.

BUG FIXES:

 - Fix bug in which `terraform init` was always called with the `-force-copy` flag ([#268](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-exec/issues/268))
 - Always pass `-no-color` flag when calling `terraform force-unlock` ([#270](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-exec/issues/270))

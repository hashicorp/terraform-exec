# 0.16.0 (January 31, 2022)

This release removes the experimental `tfinstall` package. We recommend users of `tfinstall` switch to https://github.com/hashicorp/hc-install.

Please note also terraform-exec's Go version support policy, which, like Go's own release policy, commits to supporting the last two major releases. This means that currently terraform-exec requires Go 1.17 or later.

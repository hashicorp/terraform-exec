# 0.9.0 (September 09, 2020)

BREAKING CHANGES:
 - `context.Context` added to `tfinstall.Find` to allow for cancellation, timeouts, etc ([#51](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-exec/issues/51))
 - You can no longer use `TF_WORKSPACE` for workspace management, you must use `Terraform.WorkspaceSelect` ([#75](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-exec/issues/75))

FEATURES:
 - Add `ErrWorkspaceExists` for when workspaces with the same name already exist when calling `Terraform.WorkspaceNew` ([#67](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-exec/issues/67))
 - Added `tfinstall.GitRef` to support installation of Terraform from a git ref instead of by released version ([#51](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-exec/issues/51))
 - Created the **tfinstall** CLI utility (this is mostly for use in things like CI automation) ([#29](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-exec/issues/29))
 - Added `ReattachOption` for plugin reattach functionality ([#78](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-exec/issues/78))

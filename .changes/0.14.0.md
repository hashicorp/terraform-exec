# 0.14.0 (June 24, 2021)

FEATURES:
 - Add `ProtocolVersion` to `ReattachConfig` struct, enabling provider protocol v6 support in reattach mode, provided that Terraform and the provider plugin are both using go-plugin v1.4.1 or later. This change is backwards-compatible, as zero values for this field are interpreted as protocol v5. ([#182](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-exec/issues/182))
 - Introduce `tfexec.Get()` for downloading modules ([#176](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-exec/issues/176))
 - Introduce `tfexec.Upgrade013()` ([#178](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-exec/issues/178))

INTERNAL:

 - Update `terraform-json` to account for changes in state & plan JSON output in Terraform v1.0.1+ ([#194](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-exec/issues/194))
 - Improve error message for incompatible Terraform version ([#191](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-exec/issues/191))
